## About myself

Hello, I'm Anton and I want to be a web developer. I studied at the Lyceum in the economic class. Then I entered the Brest State University. I study at the Faculty of Electronic Information Systems with a degree in industrial electronics. At the beginning of the 3rd course, I became interested in web development and have been doing it to this day. I have experience in an IT company developing transport monitoring applications. It was an internship from the university lasting 2 months. During development, I used the Javascript programming language, the React library and the Redux data management system. I proved to be responsible, hardworking, inquisitive and assiduous. And I also identified my weaknesses and continued to work on them. That's why I'm here.
